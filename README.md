# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a Junior Developer, I do my best to start in the amazing world of web development. Fortunately, practice is key to learn from mistakes and keep growing as a developer.

My latest projects are small apps that users can interact with, mainly integrating HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, and React. I always try to comply with responsive design best practices, being focused on visual design and accessibility, besides testing them to make sure they work well on any device.

I can take web designs and turn them into code to create products with a friendly user experience, as well as build my projects following the mobile-first principle, with usability and responsive design best practices in mind. Always enthusiastic for new challenges, I have strong analytical skills together with a can-do attitude.
